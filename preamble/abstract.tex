Understanding  spatial  openness  in  residential  housing  is  important  for  enhancing  living  quality  and  guiding architectural design. 
This study proposes a multifaceted evaluation method of spatial openness in rental housing by leveraging large-scale data from Tokyoâ€™s 23 wards. 
Visibility Graph Analysis (VGA) is applied to floor plan images  to  assess  two-dimensional  spatial  connectivity.  
In  addition,  semantic  segmentation  is  performed  on interior photos to capture three-dimensional openness features such as window ratios and ceiling visibility. 
The study investigates how openness characteristics vary by geographic location and construction year, identifying spatial  and  temporal  patterns.  
Finally,  it  explores  the  relationship  between  these  openness  features  and subjective housing preferences, providing insights into how spatial openness influences perceived residential quality.
